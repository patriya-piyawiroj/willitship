## implemented

- [ ] company data searcher (should be in a sepaate backend, but put it here for fast development for now)
- [ ] traditional credit scoring (based on company data)
- [ ] credit scoring with addtion to transactions happening on our platform? (sounds good, lets discuss)

Notes:
- Does the OCR need company name to verify whether the extracted company name is correct or not? 
- Rule based or AI credit scoring?
- Black listed buyers and sellers?
- Need to design the user flow
